# Contributing

## New Issues 

Before you generate an issue:

+ Take a look at the list of currently unresloved issues, bug reports and feature requests.
+ If your issue, or a very similar issue, has already been submitted bump/upvote the issue or leave a comment rather than gnerating a new issue. 

## Contributing

The most valuabe contributions to the repo are ones which add new, previously unexplored, content. This could be new sections in existing articles or new articles all together. Try to make your articles as high qualty as possible, consider including:

+ Diagrams
+ References
+ Examples
+ Relevant code snippets
+ Scripts

Remember --> everyone learns diffrently try to use many diffrent approaches to exploring a topic, think about what helps you learn and understand and try to capture that in your contributions.

Unlike many repos on GitHub no contribution to this repo will not be considered 'to small'. Even minimal additions or changes can be extremely valuable (remember that time you couldn't find quite the right payload for a CTF ...)!

If you can't validate or find a refrence which supports a conclusion in your contribution make a comment describing why you think what you have said is right or potential issues with your description(s).

## Thank You!

Lastly thanks for contributing to this project! I hope that one day this repo can be a useful resource for people on all parts of their security journey.
